          <h2>Understanding the problem</h2>

          <p>
            More than half of adults in Canada take at least 1 prescription
            medication each month. Following instructions and using medications
            exactly as prescribed helps people stay as healthy as possible with
            the least risk of harm. While medication routines are simple on
            paper, in reality, they often clash with busy schedules, classes,
            work and other responsibilities.
          </p>

          <p class="callout">
            There are simply too many steps, too many reminders and too much
            uncertainty.
          </p>

          <p>
            At the same time, healthcare is increasingly self-managed between
            appointments. People are expected to track dosages, refill
            prescriptions and show up to their appointments prepared. Most rely
            on a patchwork of different systems including alarms, notes, pill
            bottles and calendars. In the end, the cognitive load of trying to
            remember everything is frustrating.
          </p>

          <p>When tracking feels tedious, it gets dropped.</p>

          <p>There is a gap in the market for a new approach.</p>

          <h2>Research and Analysis</h2>

          <p>
            In order to understand the pain points of adults regularly taking
            one or more prescription medications, a survey was conducted. This
            survey provides insights into the habits and struggles of potential
            users. As the user success of the app is dependent on adherence, the
            feedback received was vital to assess demand and test the idea prior
            to development.
          </p>

          <p>
            The goal behind the survey is to understand how often people miss
            doses, what makes adherence hard and whether a medication and
            appointment reminder app would be useful.
          </p>

            This journey highlights Richard’s struggle to balance his
            professional life and manage his health. From the journey, it’s
            clear that he struggles with follow-through and overwhelm. He would
            benefit from a solution that minimizes his cognitive load while
            being portable and easily referenced while at work or during his
            commute.

          </figure>

          <p>
            The color palette was chosen based on several factors. Firstly, note
            the use of Black and White. These are intentionally not absolute in
            value to give them a more organic look and feel. The color blue was
            chosen because it is calming and non-aggressive. Green and red are
            used as indicators. Green confirms that the medication schedule was
            adhered to and red is intended to be used for warnings, alerts and
            incomplete fields. It is also used to indicate that a list item (eg:
            a medication) can be removed from the list.

          <p>
            Inter is an open source font designed specifically for digital
            interfaces. Inter stays highly readable at small sizes. Since this
            app relies on quickly scanning the interface to identify key info
            like medication times, Inter’s clean letterforms and number clarity
            will ensure readability and help prevent mistakes.
          </p>

          <h3>Icons</h3>
          <p>
            Icons were used in the design to highlight key areas and signify the

          <p>
            The goal behind a usability test is to evaluate if users can
            complete the primary functions of the app using the prototype. The
            test focuses on medication scheduling, logging a dose, adding a new
            medication and booking an appointment with a doctor. The results
            will be used to identify usability issues and guide iterative
            improvements.
          </p>

          <p>
            A sample of participants (5-10) representing the target audience
            will complete moderated sessions using a think-aloud approach.They
            will complete a set of tasks that include signing in, identifying
            the next medication due, logging a taken dose and adding a new
            medication with frequency and time etc.
          </p>

          <p>
            For each task, the moderator will record the outcome, time spent on
            the task and observable errors (eg: wrong inputs). The participants’
            comments will be captured. Additionally, a post-testing survey will
            be provided to gather feedback.
          </p>

          <p>
            The findings will be organized into qualitative feedback grouped by
            areas such as navigation, status understanding and readability.
            These issues will be prioritized based on severity and addressed in
            subsequent iterations of the product.

          <h2>Reflection</h2>

          <p>
            Following a structured UX design process helped transform an initial
            idea based on user pain points into a clearer product that solves
            specific user problems. It became clear which screen mattered the
            most to users and what information had to be easily accessible.
          </p>

          <p>
            The main challenge was balancing simplicity with the complexity of
            medication management (eg: checking schedule, logging a dose, adding
            new meds). This was mainly addressed by keeping a consistent
            structure and ensuring that the pages were not cluttered with
            information.

          <p>
            MedMinder is a mobile application designed to help users manage
            their medications and appointments in a simple and reliable way. The
            solution focuses on reducing the amount of missed doses and
            forgotten appointments by combining a clear schedule view, an
            organized medication list and an easy system to add new medications
            and create reminders. The prototype demonstrates the core experience
            and the key features required to encourage medication adherence.
            Future improvements can be made to refine navigation and improve
            overall accessibility. Overall, the solution is well-positioned to
            enter the market and be used by users looking to streamline their
            medication management.
